1. I opened the capture.pcapng file and analysed it using Wireshark. I noticed that there were several unusual requests such as `BT-DHT	146	Get_peers Info_hash=0847261da50df29a6d5126cff58b594f4f609275`. When I searched up what BT-DHT network protocol means, I obtained this" "The BitTorrent DHT (Distributed Hash Table) network is a decentralized system that allows BitTorrent users to find each other and the files they want to share without relying on a central tracker." I guessed that Get_peers was probably the name of a torrent file and "0847261da50df29a6d5126cff58b594f4f609275" was its hash. 

2. In order to get the link for the torrent, I went to https://www.hashtomagnet.com, a website that generates the magnet link of a torrent using its name and info hash.

3. Then, I downloaded a BitTorrent client from https://transmissionbt.com. After downloading the torrent, I got a password-protected file absolute_cinema.zip that contained a file called masterpiece.mov.

4. I tried cracking the password of absolute_cinema.zip using John The Ripper and the default wordlist rockyou.txt, but it didn't work.

5. Then, I tried using another password cracker, hashcat:
